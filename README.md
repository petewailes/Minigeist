# Minigeist

Minigeist is a minimalist [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org) theme built to use the least CSS possible and still have something responsive and beautiful. T&C runs a lightly extended version of it, so here's a [demo](https://toughcompetent.com/) of something similar to it.

## Features

* Endlessly responsive
* Typography friendly
* 4kb CSS
* Syntax highlighting using highlight.js baked in

## Installation

1. Download the files using the GitHub .zip download
2. Unzip the files and rename the folder to 'Minigeist'
4. Upload the folder to 'ghost/content/themes'
5. Restart ghost and log in
6. Go to settings > themes and select **Minigeist**
